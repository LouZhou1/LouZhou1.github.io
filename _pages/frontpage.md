title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Lou Zhou and I am a current Freshman at Rice University double majoring in Statistics and Sports Analytics. I'm originally from Memphis, Tennessee, graduating from Memphis University School in 2023.

Having played soccer since I was 5, I'm a huge sports fan, and I'm particularly interested in the applications of statistics to answer questions in the sports world, and I try to investigate any problems that I find interesting in my blog.

Currently, I work as a technical team analyst for the Rice Sports Analytics Team(RSAT) where we provide major data analytics decisions and insights for Rice Athletics. Right now, I am working on analyzing the correlation between practice intensity and offensive line performance, trying to find the perfect intensity for the Offensive Line to maxmimize output in games. I also work as a research assistant under the mentorship of Dr. Scott Powers in his lab, where I will be working on a soccer related project starting next academic year.

Previously, I've worked as an intern for the Shelby County Election Commission where I developed two in-house python programs which amalgamated and cleaned previous precinct data to match up with redrawn districts and as an intern for the Air Force Research Laboratory(AFRL), where I used computer vision to create a Python script which would find certain objects of interest in a busy image using a normalized cross-correlation algorithm to prepare images from training in a machine learning algorithm.

I'm lucky enough to be a student under the Rice Department of Sport Management, which has allowed me to do some really cool things in the sports world. I've worked as a talent escort for the 2023 NHL Awards in Nashville, and I will be working backstage during the 2024 College Football National Championship in January.

Outside of statistics, I enjoy woodworking, gardening(and cooking using what I've grown), and playing soccer.
